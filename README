# Git Event Bus

This event bus sits between the client of the repository and the repository itself and listens to the
conversation happening between the two. Additionally, the bus is configured to receive notifications
generated in the client's githook scripts.

Thus, there are two components: the git-http-backend listener and the vanilla http REST listener.

## git-http-backend listener

Used to capture the following events:
    * pull
    * info
    * clone

## http listener

Events sent from local (client) repo:
    * post-merge
    * pre-rebase
    * (pre|post)-commit
    * post-checkout
        + will emit a clone event if an appropriate checkout is detected
    * post-rewrite -- not implemented yet
    * (pre|post)-patch -- not implemented

Events sent from the remote repo:
    * (pre|post)-push -- corresponds to (pre|post)-receive
